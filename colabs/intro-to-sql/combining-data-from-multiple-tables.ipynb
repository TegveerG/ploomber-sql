    "## Combining Multiple Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "When combining more than two tables, it is imperative to know what the final result of our joins will look like. If we are familiar with the desired output before executing our queries, we can make an informed decision on whether to use an `INNER JOIN`, `OUTER JOIN`, or `FULL JOIN` to achieve our desired result. In short, assessing the case at hand will help us determine the type of join to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "To quickly refresh our memory from the previous tutorial on [`INNER JOIN`](https://ploomber-sql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro-to-sql/joining-data-in-sql.html#inner-join), recall that an `INNER JOIN` is suitable when we want to retrieve only the matching records, effectively filtering out any unmatched records, between the tables involved in the join. Therefore, the result will contain only the rows where the join condition is met in all the joined tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, an `OUTER JOIN` can be of three types: <b>Left, Right, and Full</b>. They were covered extensively in the [previous tutorial](https://ploomber-sql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro-to-sql/joining-data-in-sql.html#left-join), but here is a quick refresher. In situations where we need to retrieve all records from one table, regardless of whether there is a match in the other tables, an `OUTER JOIN` can be used. This is particularly useful when we want to <b>include supplementary information or handle missing data</b>. A `LEFT JOIN` includes all rows from the left table (the table specified before the LEFT JOIN keyword) and the matching rows from the right table(s) (the table(s) specified after the `LEFT JOIN` keyword). Similarly, a `RIGHT JOIN` includes all rows from the right table(s) and the matching rows from the left table. A `FULL JOIN` combines operations of both the `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`, including all rows from both tables and matching rows where the join condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, understanding the desired output and the relationships between the tables will help us determine whether an `INNER JOIN` or an `OUTER JOIN` is more appropriate for obtaining the desired result. By utilizing the appropriate join type and leveraging primary and foreign keys, we can combine data from multiple tables efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### INNER JOIN\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we want to retrieve common data points between the `account`, `card`, `district`, and `link` tables because unmatched records represent churned customers who do not utilize this bank's services anymore. Therefore, we can use the `INNER JOIN` to join the `account`, `card`, `district`, and `link` tables on their respective foreign keys. The query below demonstrates how we can use the `INNER JOIN` to join the four tables:"

Unmatched records could represent customers who have recently opened accounts or received new cards and are yet to make any transactions. Write a SQL query to join the `account`, `card`, `district`, and `link` tables from the `s1` schema in the DuckDB database. Include only primary key columns from each table in the result set.\n",

    "Recall that in the [previous tutorial](https://ploomber-sql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro-to-sql/joining-data-in-sql.html#what-is-a-primary-key-and-a-foreign-key), we learned that the `account` table contains a column named `district_id`, which serves as a foreign key referencing the primary key in the `district` table. Similarly, the `card` table has a column named `disp_id`, which is a foreign key referencing the primary key in the `link` table. By utilizing these relationships, we can perform a join operation on these tables to obtain a consolidated result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "To combine the `account`, `card`, `district`, and `link` tables, we can use the following SQL query:\n",

    "ON c.disp_id = l.disp_id; \n",

    "\n",
    "In this query, we are performing a series of `INNER JOIN` operations to merge the tables based on the specified join conditions. The `ON` clause defines the relationship between the columns that are used for joining. The `SELECT` statement retrieves only the primary keys from each of the joined tables in the result set.\n",

    "Suppose that the bank is planning to hike interest rates on accounts because the districts, where they have their branches, have gentrified over the past couple of years. We want to analyze not only the activity of customers across different districts based on their account and card information, but also district-level statistics (employment rate and crime rate). However, we also want to include customers who have recently opened accounts or received new cards and are yet to make any transactions. Therefore, we should use an `OUTER JOIN`, preferably the `LEFT JOIN`, so that we can capture records of all customers and appropriately conduct a district-wide analysis.\n",

    "In contrast to the `INNER JOIN`, the order of the tables plays an important role in the `LEFT JOIN`, and the results may be completely different if the order changes in your SQL query. When determining the order of tables in a `LEFT JOIN`, the <b>general rule is to start with the table from which you want to keep all the records in the final result</b>. Therefore, in the above example, instead of starting with the `account` table, we started with the `district` table, because we want to keep all the records from the `district` table in the final result.\n",

    "<b>Hint:</b> We can use both `INNER JOIN` and `OUTER JOIN` in a single query! The first step would be to think about the type of `JOIN` to combine the `links` and `cards` tables.

    "\n",
    "The `FULL OUTER JOIN` will return all rows from both tables, and if there are no matches, the columns from the other table will be filled with `NULL` values. This is in contrast to the `INNER JOIN`, which only returns rows that have matching values in both tables and, hence, no `NULL` values.\n",

The rows from the `account` and `district` tables that do not have matching values in the `links` and `cards` tables will not be included in the final output.

    "In this section, we learnt about how to join more than two tables. To summarize:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When combining multiple tables, it is important to understand the desired output and the relationships between the tables to determine the appropriate join type.\n",

Both functions combine rows from multiple tables, based on specified join conditions. <b>They return only the rows that have matching values in both tables being joined</b>. The join conditions are specified using the `ON` keyword, where you define the columns from each table that should be compared for the join.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An `OUTER JOIN`, such as the `LEFT JOIN`, can be used to retrieve all records from one table regardless of whether there is a match in the other tables. This is useful when including supplementary information or handling missing data.\n",
