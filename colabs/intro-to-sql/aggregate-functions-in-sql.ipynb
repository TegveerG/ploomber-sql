    "# Aggregate functions in SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last section, we learned the basics of SQL. We now build upon those basics to learn a common use case of SQL: <b>aggregation functions</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation functions are useful for summarizing your data and for finding meaningful insights. The most common of these functions are `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `SUM()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()`. We will go over each of these functions in detail with our bank marketing dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also introduce the important clause `GROUP BY`. This clause can only be used if, and only if, aggregation functions are used. However, note that aggregation functions can be used without `GROUP BY`. `GROUP BY` groups unique values in columns together and runs an aggregation function on each unique group. Examples of using `GROUP BY` will be provided after introducing aggregate functions.\n",
