    "# Introduction to `ipywidgets`\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back! We hope you gained a solid introduction to SQL and JupySQL in the first module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, did you know that you can use widgets, eventful Python objects that have a representation in the browser, to build fully interactive GUIs for your SQL query?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section of Interactive Queries and Parameterization, we introduce `ipywidgets` and demonstrate how to create widgets and their functionality. Moreover, you can use widgets to synchronize stateful and stateless information between Python and JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ipywidgets`, which is part of the Jupyter Widgets project, is a Python package that provides interactive HTML widgets for Jupyter notebooks and the IPython kernel. The package provides a basic, lightweight set of controls that allows for easy implementations of interactive user interfaces. These controls comprise a text area, text box, select and multiselect controls, checkbox, sliders, tab panels, grid layout, etc.\n",

    "### Numeric Widgets\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many widgets distributed with `ipywidgets` that are designed to display numeric values. Widgets exist for displaying integers and floats, both bounded and unbounded. The integer widgets share a similar naming scheme to their floating point counterparts. By replacing \"Float\" with \"Int\" in the widget name, you can find the Integer equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `IntSlider` and `FloatSlider`\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric widgets provide further flexibility over basic data types. For example, the `IntSlider` and the `FloatSlider`, the simplest numeric widgets, can be employed to filter <b>integer</b> and <b>float</b> values respectively within a range (`min` and `max`) of your choice along with a `step` size and the `value` at which the slider is initialized. Moreover, we can create a bounded slider, indicated by the `<=` operator, or an unbounded slider, indicated by the `>=` operator, to filter the dataset within or outside our range of values respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several other arguments, which can be found [here](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Widget%20List.html#IntSlider), that can be passed into these sliders.\n",

    "Let's start by importing `ipywidgets` into your notebook, along with the `display` module from `IPython.display`\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating a widget, you can display it using the `display()` function. An example for the `IntSlider` and its display is as follows:"
